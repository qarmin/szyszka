# Szyszka

Szyszka is simple but powerful file rename.

Allows user to easily create rules which will be used to step by step rename files

## Status
Currently Szyszka is in very early WIP and doesn't even work for now

I want to add before 1.0 release:
- Multiple Rules:
  - Uppercase/Downcase names
  - Search and Replace
  - Add text(date, file size, modification date)
  - Remove specific text
  - Add specific number(01,02,001,002 etc.)
  - Maybe Regex support(unlikely in short term)
  - Append folder name
- Better UI
- Adding entire folders

## Name 
Szyszka is Polish word which means Conifer Cone
