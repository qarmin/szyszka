## Name 
Szyszka is Polish word which means Pinecone

Why such strange name?

Would you remember another app name like Rename Files Ultra?  
Probably no.  
But will you remember name Szyszka?  
Well... probably also no, but when you heard this name instantly you will think about this app.

## Why?
I know that on Linux which I primarily use, there is a lot of good file renamers(and even more on Windows), but I coulnd't find any feasible for me.  
Available apps installs a lot of dependences, works slowly or just have very bloatet UI.
