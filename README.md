## Features
- Written in Rust
- Available for Linux, Mac and Windows
- Very simple GUI created using GTK3
- Multiple rules which can be freely combined:
  - Replace text
  - Trim text
  - Add text

  - Use custom rules


## Requirements
### Linux
You need to install GTK (it should be available by default on most distributions) and the canberra-gtk-module.
```shell
sudo apt install libgtk3-dev libcanberra-gtk-module
```
### MacOS (not tested)
You need to install GTK using brew
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install rust gtk+3
```

### Windows
The released zip file contains all dependencies and has been tested to work out of the box on a freshly installed Windows 7 SP1.  
If you want to, you can install the GTK runtime from https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases, ensure that its environment variables are set properly and run Szyszka from anywhere.

## Contribution

When creating or modifying existing rules, don't forget about updating/adding tests!

## Name 
Szyszka is Polish word which means Pinecone.

Why such a strange name?

Would you remember another app name like Rename Files Ultra?  
Probably not.  
But will you remember name Szyszka?  
Well... probably also not, but when you hear this name, you will instantly think of this app.

## Why?
I know that on Linux, which I primarily use, there is a lot of good file renamers (and even more on Windows), but I couldn't find any that would suit my needs.
Available apps install a lot of dependencies, work slowly or just have a very bloated UI.
